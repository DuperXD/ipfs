# Pinata IPFS Configuration
# Get your keys from: https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys

# REQUIRED: Pinata JWT Token (Recommended - Use this one)
VITE_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token_here

# OPTIONAL: API Key and Secret (Alternative authentication method)
VITE_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key_here
VITE_PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key_here

# OPTIONAL: Your Custom Pinata Gateway (Faster than public gateways)
# Example: https://chocolate-accepted-galliform-350.mypinata.cloud
# Find yours at: https://app.pinata.cloud/gateway
VITE_PINATA_GATEWAY=

# IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to: .env
# 2. Replace "your_pinata_jwt_token_here" with your actual JWT from Pinata
# 3. (Optional) Add your custom Pinata gateway URL above for faster loading
# 4. NEVER commit the .env file to git (it's already in .gitignore)
# 5. Only the JWT is required - you can leave the API_KEY and SECRET_KEY empty

# HOW TO GET PINATA KEYS:
# 1. Go to https://pinata.cloud
# 2. Sign up for free account
# 3. Go to API Keys section
# 4. Create new key
# 5. Copy the JWT token
# 6. Paste it above

# HOW TO GET YOUR CUSTOM GATEWAY:
# 1. Go to https://app.pinata.cloud/gateway
# 2. Copy your dedicated gateway URL (e.g., https://xxx-xxx-xxx-350.mypinata.cloud)
# 3. Paste it in VITE_PINATA_GATEWAY above (without /ipfs/ at the end)

# NOTE: Without these keys, the app will use simulated IPFS (files won't be actually uploaded)
